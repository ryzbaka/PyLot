A web based IDE for writing ETL pipelines in Python.

Writing code for data processing in Jupyter nodebooks is the standard for most Python developers, 
**PyLot** aims to bring the same workflow to the web and make code deployment ready so that you don't have
to spend hours converting your data ETL pipeline from a Jupyter notebook to production code that you can schedule to run
whenever you please while also keeping track of your servers, which you can access using PyLot's web terminal.
