A web based IDE for writing ETL pipelines in Python.

Writing code for data processing in Jupyter nodebooks is the standard for most Python developers, 
**PyLot** aims to bring the same workflow to the web and make code deployment ready so that you don't have
to spend hours converting your data ETL pipeline from a Jupyter notebook to production code that you can schedule to run
whenever you please while also keeping track of your linux servers that you can access using PyLot's web terminal.

Feature Roadmap:
* Server health monitor. (deployed to production ✔)
* Web Terminal that connects to your servers. (deployed to production ✔)
* PyLot Notebook interface (currently in development 💻)
* Python text editor (currently in development 💻)
* Pipeline scheduler (currently in development 💻)
* Community developed templates for common ETL tasks
* Electron application
